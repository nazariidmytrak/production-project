            "There are other ways to run JS code in the browser. For example, in common usage, JavaScript programs are loaded into the browser to make web pages work. As a rule, the code is designed as separate files with the extension .js, which are attached to web pages, but program code can also be included directly in the code of the page. All this is done with the <script> tag. When the browser detects such code, it executes it. You can learn more about the script tag at w3school.com. In particular, let's look at an example that demonstrates how to work with a web page using JavaScript, given on this resource. This example can also be run using this resource (look for the Try it Yourself button), but we'll do things a little differently. Namely, we'll create a new file in a text editor (e.g., VS Code or Notepad++) called hello.html and add the following code to it:"
